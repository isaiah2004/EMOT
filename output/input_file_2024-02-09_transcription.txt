[0.00]  Okay, welcome to introductory calculus.
[16.34]  I will start with some practical information.
[20.00]  Then I'll tell you a little bit about the syllabus and what we will cover in this course.
[26.48]  And then give you some examples of differential equations from physical sciences and then
[36.02]  a little bit of integration towards the end.
[38.42]  So for many of you, this might be the easiest course that you'll take in Oxford.
[46.90]  But I think things will get progressively harder.
[50.14]  So maybe in a couple of weeks, it will be interesting to everybody if today's lecture might be
[55.98]  a bit too easy for some of you.
[58.42]  Okay, so let me tell you some practical information.
[69.18]  So we have 16 lectures.
[75.22]  The lecture notes are online.
[85.22]  Online, these are the lecture notes.
[88.22]  These were written by CAHP Wilkins.
[95.22]  She taught this course for a few years until last year.
[102.62]  So we'll just follow them.
[106.86]  I guess I should have introduced myself at some point.
[110.22]  So the lecture, so you can call me Dan.
[118.90]  My name is Dan Chibotaru.
[124.06]  We'll meet twice a week.
[128.58]  Today is special just because it's the first week we'll meet on Mondays and Wednesdays at
[133.74]  10 a.m. so not too early.
[139.90]  And you'll have eight problem sheets.
[147.06]  So the first two problem sheets are online.
[150.70]  The eight problem sheets you'll cover in four tutorials in your college.
[163.14]  So four hours of tutorial.
[170.50]  So I said the lecture notes online.
[172.26]  The reading list is also online.
[177.78]  You see online, the book that I like is Mary Boeus' mathematical methods in physical
[190.94]  sciences.
[196.18]  This book.
[202.46]  And most of your colleges should have a copy of this if not the university does as well.
[214.14]  So this book is quite concise and it has various examples from physics and engineering and
[222.30]  so it also has the added advantage that if unlike the other books on the reading list,
[229.06]  if you drop this one on your foot, you might be able to walk without seeing an orthopedic
[236.06]  surgeon.
[239.06]  All right.
[242.42]  So that's any questions about this.
[247.86]  Okay.
[248.86]  Now, syllabus.
[260.82]  So the first half of the course about seven or eight lectures will be devoted to differential
[269.38]  equations.
[270.38]  So this is about seven or eight lectures.
[276.26]  You have two kinds, ordinary differential equations.
[287.10]  All these and partial differential equations or PDs.
[303.66]  So I'll give you some examples very soon.
[308.22]  We'll look at fairly easy examples of differential equations.
[312.50]  We'll learn some techniques.
[315.66]  It's a combination, solving them.
[317.26]  It's a combination of science and art.
[319.70]  You have to do some educated guesses at some point.
[323.30]  But it's quite an interesting and very useful subject.
[330.30]  And then after that, we'll talk about line and double integrals, line integrals and
[339.34]  double integrals.
[342.10]  And the reason these are useful is because we will be able to compute art lengths of curves
[354.74]  and areas of various regions in the plane or surfaces.
[364.38]  So this is maybe three lectures.
[371.74]  And then finally, we'll do calculus of functions in two variables.
[387.74]  So this should be viewed as a gentle introduction into multi-variable calculus.
[394.30]  So among the things that we'll do, we'll look at various surfaces, gradients, normal vectors,
[406.26]  we'll look at Taylor's theorem into variables, critical points, and a little bit of Lagrange
[417.26]  multipliers, which are useful for optimization problems.
[429.98]  Now there is a lot of interaction between this course and other pre-limb courses that you
[436.10]  will take.
[438.10]  So intercalculus will be directly useful, obviously, multi-variable calculus, as I said.
[455.78]  In a way, it's a little bit unfair.
[459.02]  We set up the work.
[460.82]  We do some examples for in-introduction calculus.
[463.98]  And then the really cool result and theorems you prove in multi-variable calculus.
[468.90]  So we just do a little bit of the groundwork towards that.
[474.22]  You also do, these are also useful in dynamics and PDEs of you will do next term for yes,
[486.74]  series, and PDEs.
[490.06]  Now there is a lot of interaction between intercalculus and analysis, particularly analysis
[497.22]  two, which is what you do next term.
[500.14]  So there will be quite a few results from analysis that will just state and not prove, maybe
[507.46]  prove some particular examples and so on.
[510.38]  But real rigorous proofs you'll do in analysis next term.
[516.82]  But then it all comes together when you revise for your exams in Trinity.
[528.82]  So as that of first in part A, there will be lots of applied mathematics options that
[534.42]  will continue this differential equations, this is a big option, fluid and waves, et cetera.
[540.38]  So this is a very useful course.
[542.82]  It's also mandatory so you have to be here.
[550.22]  So now let me give you some examples of where all these might appear.
[564.54]  OK, so all these.
[571.70]  So what is an ordinary differential equation?
[576.50]  So this is an equation involving an independent variable.
[593.30]  Let's call it x and a function of x, which we call it y.
[610.90]  So y, this would be the dependent variable.
[621.06]  And the derivatives of y with respect to x.
[631.82]  So for example, dy dx, d squared y dx squared, et cetera.
[641.86]  So the order of the highest derivative that occurs, we call that the order of the differential
[648.50]  equation.
[650.50]  So for example, the simplest of ODE would be something of the form dy dx equals some function in x.
[676.22]  So dy dx equals f of x, you can solve that by direct integration.
[681.74]  So this can be solved.
[688.74]  So y equals, so y you can think of y as being the anti derivative of f of x.
[703.22]  And then we can use integrations.
[706.58]  That's the simplest kind of differential equation that we can have.
[713.66]  And this is the reason why we'll start the course by reviewing a little bit of integration techniques.
[722.22]  But more interesting, there could be more interesting differential equations.
[727.06]  So let me give you some examples from physical sciences.
[735.70]  So for example, from mechanics, this is something that you have all seen.
[744.58]  You can have Newton's second law, which says that the force is the mass times
[756.82]  the acceleration.
[758.06]  So A is the acceleration.
[766.94]  But then the acceleration is a derivative of the velocity with respect to time.
[783.50]  So that's already a differential equation.
[786.54]  But it could be a second order differential equation if you think that V is dT, where R is the displacement.
[804.30]  Then you get, for example, A is the R, the squared R, dT squared, which is a second order differential equation.
[814.26]  So that's an easy example of how differential equations appear in mechanics.
[822.98]  Well, you could also have differential equations in engineering, or if you have an electrical circuit.
[841.30]  So if I take a simple one, so a simple series circuit, which, for example, an RLC circuit,
[854.58]  which means that it has the following components.
[859.22]  It has R stands for resistor.
[863.14]  So it has a resistor R. It has an inductor L with inductance L.
[874.78]  And it has a capacitor with capacitance C. And it has a source of voltage, something like a battery V.
[893.02]  So here's, so I have a capacitor with C capacitance.
[902.66]  And the resistor with R resistance.
[910.26]  And an inductor with L inductance.
[920.82]  So here R, R, L, and C are constants.
[927.82]  They're independent of time.
[933.22]  But then I'm interested, for example, in the current across the circuit.
[940.10]  So this is the current across I of t is the current across the circuit,
[949.26]  which is a function of the time.
[957.90]  So in terms of differential equations, t the time would be the independent variable.
[963.10]  And this I of t, for example, is a dependent variable.
[967.70]  I can also have Q of t, which is the charge across the capacitor, sorry, on the capacitor.
[985.86]  And the relation between the two of them is that I is dQ dt.
[996.30]  So Kirchhoff's law says that the total voltage is 0 around the circuit,
[1010.34]  which is in another way the voltage V from the battery, which is a function of t,
[1020.62]  equals the voltage across the resistor plus the voltage across the inductor plus the
[1027.42]  voltage on the capacitor.
[1030.62]  And now you write each one of them.
[1036.98]  The voltage across the resistor by Ohm's law is R times I of t.
[1051.42]  The one on the capacitor is just 1 over C times the charge.
[1060.70]  And for the inductor is L, the constant times dI dt, which is Faraday's law.
[1077.10]  So now I can express, for example, so I have an equation involving V, I and Q.
[1087.90]  But I is dQ dt, so I can rewrite everything in terms of Q, for example.
[1093.94]  So I can get a differential equation in Q, which will be simply, so this would be the
[1110.14]  leading term, dI dt.
[1112.54]  So L times dI dt becomes L times d squared Q dt squared plus R i is R times dQ dt plus 1 over
[1127.58]  C times Q equals V.
[1131.62]  So that is a second order differential equation that appears in electrical circuits.
[1145.66]  So it's second order because the highest derivative is of second order.
[1150.90]  It has constant coefficients because the constants are L, R, and C are constant.
[1158.30]  And it's what we'll call in homogeneous because this doesn't have to be zero.
[1165.82]  So those are the type of differential equations that we can study.
[1173.18]  And there are many other examples, so I'll leave one as an exercise for you.
[1181.98]  An easy exercise.
[1186.18]  I'll tell you the problem is the rate at which a radioactive substance decays is proportional
[1214.06]  to the remaining number of atoms.
[1226.66]  So I want you to, as an exercise, to write a differential equation that describes this
[1233.70]  situation.
[1236.54]  So we'll come back to things like this later.
[1240.82]  So the question is, what's the differential equation?
[1252.30]  OK.
[1260.78]  So as you progress along in this course, in the mathematics course here, you will encounter
[1268.22]  very, very interesting and sophisticated differential equations in applied mathematics.
[1275.58]  So we're just scratching the surface a little bit.
[1281.02]  All right.
[1282.02]  Now going back to what I said before, the simplest kind of OD is dy dx equals f of x,
[1291.42]  which you can solve by direct integration.
[1295.14]  So let me review a couple of facts about integration.
[1301.86]  So one of the most useful techniques, which I'm sure most of you are quite familiar with,
[1308.50]  is integration by parts.
[1324.46]  So does integration by parts come from?
[1328.02]  Well, it comes from the product rule, product or live needs rule, if you want to sound fancy
[1338.46]  for derivatives.
[1347.02]  So if I have two functions, f and g, and I multiply them, and then I differentiate,
[1354.02]  and so fg times g prime is f prime g plus fg prime, which means that fg, f times g prime equals
[1368.74]  f times g prime minus f prime times g.
[1376.54]  And if I integrate both sides, then I end up with the integration by parts, which is
[1389.48]  f times g prime dx, if their functions of x equals f times g minus f prime times g dx.
[1406.28]  So this is the version, the indefinite interblow version.
[1410.84]  You can have a definite interblow version where you put the limits of integration.
[1420.56]  So let me spell it out.
[1427.64]  So this is the definite interglow version.
[1434.76]  All right.
[1436.64]  So let's do a couple of examples.
[1449.00]  So the first example.
[1455.48]  So suppose I want to integrate x squared sine x.
[1467.28]  So this would solve, so this gives the solution to dy dx equals x squared sine x.
[1485.28]  So in the integration by parts, you have to decide which one is f and which one's g.
[1493.88]  Now clearly I would like to decrease the power here.
[1498.60]  I know I can never get rid of the sine by differentiation.
[1502.64]  So then maybe this, then I have to do this f and this is g prime, which means that g
[1511.76]  is minus cos x.
[1515.80]  So if I call this interblow i, i is x squared times minus cos x and then minus the derivative
[1529.20]  of f, which is 2x times minus cos x dx.
[1537.40]  This is minus x squared cos x plus 2 times x cos x dx.
[1549.40]  And now again, this should be f and this should be g prime.
[1557.44]  So cos x plus 2 times x sine x minus 2 times sine x dx.
[1572.72]  So please try to follow through what I'm doing.
[1576.12]  And let me know if I make a mistake.
[1578.36]  This is my nightmare to do integrals like this while I'm being filmed.
[1585.28]  Right?
[1586.28]  Exactly what I like to do.
[1589.96]  So 2x sine x and then minus cos x, then plus c.
[1600.72]  Is this?
[1603.56]  So plus, plus, thank you.
[1609.20]  Good.
[1612.20]  As I said.
[1614.60]  So c here denotes a constant because we're doing indefinite integrals.
[1625.24]  All right.
[1626.00]  Let's do another example.
[1645.44]  So again, an indefinite integral 2x minus 1 times ln x squared plus 1 dx.
[1653.92]  OK.
[1656.92]  What do you think?
[1663.40]  Which one should be f and which one should be g or g prime?
[1669.28]  Say that again.
[1674.60]  Right.
[1678.88]  So this, I want to differentiate to get rid of the logarithm.
[1682.48]  So I should call this f, which means that this is going to be g prime.
[1685.92]  Thank you.
[1688.36]  And that makes g x squared minus x.
[1693.68]  So this becomes x squared minus x times ln x squared plus 1 minus the integral of x squared
[1703.40]  minus x times the derivative of the natural log of x squared plus 1, which is 2x over x squared
[1715.36]  plus 1 dx.
[1718.20]  So finally this term, what do I do here?
[1728.32]  Good.
[1728.88]  So we do a long division.
[1733.44]  So let's rewrite it versus this x squared minus x ln x squared plus 1.
[1740.92]  And then minus 2x cubed minus x squared over x squared plus 1 dx.
[1748.60]  So I have to remember how to do long division.
[1753.80]  So I have x cubed minus x.
[1758.68]  Now, depending how you learn this, you will draw the long division in different ways.
[1766.48]  So you just do it your way.
[1768.80]  And now I'll do it my way.
[1771.52]  So that's x minus x cubed minus x squared minus x minus x minus 1.
[1795.80]  OK, so this means that x cubed minus x squared over x squared plus 1 equals x minus 1 plus
[1808.88]  minus x plus 1 over x squared plus 1.
[1816.44]  Did you get the same thing?
[1820.64]  OK, so let's call this integral j.
[1824.28]  And now we compute j, the integral of x minus 1 plus minus x plus 1 over x squared plus
[1836.08]  1 dx, which equals x squared minus 1, half x squared minus x.
[1849.20]  And then how do I integrate this term, the fraction?
[1861.84]  So I should split x over x squared plus 1 dx.
[1873.16]  And let me write the last term plus dx over x squared plus 1.
[1882.08]  So this one, the last term, we should recognize that what is it?
[1887.64]  R10 or 10 inverse, depending how you want to denote it.
[1892.40]  This is R10 of x, just 10 inverse of x.
[1900.08]  So what do we do with this?
[1903.04]  We can substitute.
[1906.24]  Yeah, let's do that so that we remember how to do substitutions.
[1914.80]  You might just look at it and know what it is, right?
[1917.12]  But just to review substitution, if I said u equals x squared plus 1, then du equals 2x,
[1926.60]  dx, du dx equals 2x, which means that this is 1, half du over u, which is 1, half ln of u,
[1944.44]  which is 1, half ln of x squared plus 1.
[1949.32]  That you might have guessed just because you have enough practice.
[1954.76]  Some of you.
[1957.68]  OK, so now let's put them all together.
[1959.92]  So j is 1, half x squared minus x minus 1, half ln x squared plus 1 plus 10 inverse of x
[1976.08]  and some constant, which means that the original integral in the beginning, which I should
[1990.24]  have called i, so that I don't have to roll down the boards, but equals x squared minus
[2002.52]  x ln x squared plus 1 minus twice this.
[2011.72]  So minus x squared plus 2x plus ln x squared plus 1 minus 10 inverse x and then plus c.
[2030.40]  Thank you.
[2031.88]  Any other mistakes?
[2032.88]  All right.
[2038.88]  OK.
[2049.08]  So that's an integral.
[2053.08]  There are cases when integration by parts will not simplify either of the two functions
[2060.84]  of f and g, but what happens is if you do it twice, then you sort of come back to what
[2066.92]  you started with.
[2067.92]  So the typical example is i equals the integral e to the x sin x dx.
[2088.84]  So maybe we don't need to go through the entire calculation.
[2096.72]  This is in the lecture notes as well, but how would you solve it?
[2108.32]  Right.
[2109.32]  So you do it.
[2110.80]  So for example, I can say that this is g prime and this is f.
[2118.32]  And then I integrate, I get cos, and then I do it again, and I will end up with some expression
[2124.16]  minus this integral, and then I solve for it.
[2127.96]  So you do this and you get the answer to be something like 1 half e to the x sin x minus
[2135.96]  cos x, then plus constant.
[2152.32]  So another type of examples, which are more difficult, are the ones which you cannot solve
[2161.92]  in just one go, but you have to find the recursive formula.
[2166.24]  So I'll just do an example like that.
[2169.96]  You've seen other examples before.
[2173.44]  So this is when we get a reduction, or if you want to call it a recursive formula.
[2191.68]  So I start, suppose I'm looking at this integral cosine to the n x dx.
[2203.84]  Now I want to label this integral i n because I'm going to get a formula of i n in terms
[2212.52]  of i n minus 1 or i n minus 2, et cetera.
[2220.04]  Now there is not much choice here what you should call f and what you should call g.
[2226.24]  So I'm going to just do it.
[2229.12]  So this is cos n minus 1 x times cos x dx.
[2236.08]  So this is f and this is g prime.
[2240.00]  And we get cos n minus 1 x sin x minus the integral.
[2250.88]  Now I need to differentiate f.
[2253.68]  So n minus 1 cos n minus 2 x.
[2258.24]  And then minus sin x.
[2262.04]  And then another sin x dx.
[2268.84]  Which equals cos n minus 1 x sin x minus n minus 1 times, or maybe I'll make it a plus,
[2282.40]  cos n minus 2 x sin squared x dx.
[2292.56]  So if I write it like that, what do you do now?
[2299.96]  Write sin squared as 1 minus cos squared x.
[2308.24]  Which then gives you cos n minus 1 x sin x plus n minus 1, the integral of cos n minus
[2319.96]  2 x dx minus n minus 1, the integral of cos n squared x dx.
[2333.12]  So now I recognize that this is the integral of cos n minus 2 is i sub n minus 2.
[2343.08]  And the integral of cos n, this is i n.
[2349.08]  So I have i n equals that.
[2352.44]  So if I solve for i n, we get i n equals, so I get n i n equals cos n minus 1 x sin x
[2376.56]  plus n minus 1 i n minus 2.
[2382.84]  Which gives me the recursive formula.
[2391.44]  i n equals 1 over n, cos n minus 1 x sin x plus n minus 1 over n i n minus 2.
[2407.52]  So this is true for all n greater than or equal to 2.
[2431.24]  Now if I want to know all of these integrals, i n using this formula, what else do I need
[2438.88]  to know?
[2442.68]  i 0 and i 1 because it drops down by 2.
[2448.80]  So let's compute i 0 and i 1.
[2451.88]  So we also need i 0 and i 1.
[2460.76]  So i 0 would be just the integral dx, which is x plus a c.
[2470.76]  And i 1 is the integral of cos x dx, which is sin x plus a c.
[2482.40]  And now with this, you can get any integral you want.
[2488.28]  For example, if you want to get i 6, you just follow that and you get that it's 1 6th
[2507.88]  cos to the 5th sin x plus 5 over 6 times i 4, which is 1 over 6 cos sin x plus 5 over
[2526.56]  6 times i 4 is 1 4th cos cubed x sin x plus 3 4th i 2.
[2544.40]  And then what's i 2?
[2547.40]  i 2 is 1 half cos x sin x plus 1 half i 0, i 0 is x.
[2560.04]  So you put your substitute this in there and they get that i 6 is 1 6th cos to the 5th
[2569.08]  sin x plus 5 over 24 cos cubed x sin x plus 5 times 3 times 1 over 6 times 4 times 2 cos
[2588.44]  x sin x plus 5 times 3 over 6 times 4 times 2 x.
[2613.68]  So, I think you can probably cook up a general formula using this example.
[2621.16]  You see how it goes.
[2622.40]  So if I ask you to write a sum involving all the terms, I think you can get the coefficients
[2630.04]  of each term inductively.
[2637.84]  So this is a quick review of integration by parts.
[2643.72]  If you're not fully comfortable with these examples or similar examples, then get an
[2652.32]  integration textbook and do a few more examples with integration by parts, substitutions,
[2658.20]  and so on.
[2659.60]  Because differential, what we will do in solving differential equations will learn a lot
[2664.36]  of techniques, but ultimately you will have to integrate some functions.
[2669.64]  So you should be able to do that.
[2671.84]  So what we'll learn is how to reduce the problem to integrating various functions.
[2678.40]  But you'll have to be able to do that.
[2684.56]  So we discussed about the simplest kind of ODEs, which can be solved just by direct
[2696.28]  integration.
[2697.72]  The next simplest ODEs are the so-called separable.
[2725.80]  So we had the case dy dx equals f of x, which you can just integrate.
[2731.92]  The next case would be dy dx equals a of x times b of y.
[2744.64]  So what I mean by that is that this is a function only in x, only, and b of y is a function
[2761.08]  of y only.
[2770.80]  If you have a situation like that, then you can reduce it to the direct integration with
[2776.76]  one simple trick.
[2779.00]  If dy is not zero, then you divide by it, and you get 1 over b of y dy dx equals a x.
[2799.36]  And now you can integrate just as we did before.
[2810.68]  So you'll get then the integral dx.
[2823.08]  So the left hand side is the integral dy over b of y, and the right hand side is a x dx.
[2830.28]  And now you have two direct integrations, which hopefully we can solve.
[2838.80]  The type of integrals that we have in this course will be the kind for which you can
[2844.40]  apply integration by parts or some other techniques and solve them.
[2848.08]  If I were to write an arbitrary function there and ask you how to integrate it, then we
[2854.60]  can't do that in a closed formula.
[2861.12]  So here's an example.
[2873.20]  In the general solution to the separable differential equation, so the hint is already
[2893.64]  in the problem that this is a separable differential equation x times y squared minus 1 plus y
[2902.48]  x squared minus 1 dy dx equals to zero.
[2909.72]  And x is between zero and 1 to avoid some issues about continuity or whatnot.
[2928.84]  How do you separate this differential equation?
[2934.44]  How do you separate the variables?
[2944.72]  So I think you're about two steps ahead of me.
[2951.08]  But it's correct.
[2953.04]  Let me do it step by step.
[2954.36]  So what I will do is first isolate that.
[2958.60]  So I have y x squared minus 1 dy dx equals minus x y squared minus 1.
[2969.96]  And then separate the variables.
[2973.76]  As the name suggests, you have y over y squared minus 1 dy dx equals minus x over x squared
[2987.76]  minus 1.
[3012.20]  What do we do now?
[3024.96]  So if we look at this, then, so we integrate, let's integrate, well, let me write one more.
[3032.24]  So we integrate this and we get y over y squared minus 1 dy equals minus x over x squared
[3041.24]  minus 1 dx.
[3048.76]  So now we could do a substitution as we did before, but I think we know how to do it.
[3055.28]  This looks like the derivative of a logarithm.
[3058.56]  So if I differentiate ln of x squared minus 1, then I get 2x over x squared minus 1.
[3070.24]  So except x is between 0 and 1.
[3076.44]  So maybe it's better to write this as 1x over 1 minus x squared.
[3081.76]  And get rid of the minus sign.
[3086.60]  So then I'll do 1 minus x squared minus 2x over 1 minus x squared.
[3095.12]  So then this is minus ln of 1 minus x squared and the half and then plus c.
[3113.48]  Whereas here, I'll have to put absolute values because I don't know.
[3117.32]  It's 1 half ln of y squared minus 1 in absolute value.
[3131.32]  Now, the easiest way to write this is to get rid of the logarithm by moving this to the
[3136.40]  other side using the properties of the logarithm and exponentiate.
[3142.16]  So let's do that.
[3143.20]  So we have 1 half.
[3146.20]  If I move the logarithm in x to the left hand side, then I use the property.
[3158.12]  Well, it doesn't matter much equals c, which means that the equation will be y squared
[3175.56]  minus 1 times 1 minus x squared, absolute value equals, it would be in to c squared.
[3188.04]  Or e to 2c, which I can just call another kind of c.
[3200.60]  And this would be a positive number.
[3206.20]  So the equation that we get is, so the answer then is that.
[3231.12]  Where c is positive.
[3234.48]  But I can relax that.
[3236.08]  This is always positive because 1 minus x squared is always positive because I'm assuming
[3241.84]  x is between 0 and 1.
[3244.72]  But I can rewrite the answer in a nicer form by dropping the absolute value and dropping
[3255.12]  the assumption on c.
[3257.60]  So another way of doing this is, well, for uniformity, I will write it as 1 minus y squared
[3273.76]  equals c.
[3276.84]  So 1 minus y squared times 1 minus x squared equals c.
[3282.00]  No assumption on c except, so c could be both positive or negative, except in this formula,
[3290.92]  it looks like it can't be 0.
[3295.40]  Right?
[3296.40]  Here I got an exponential, which is never 0.
[3300.28]  So this is positive.
[3303.12]  I drop the absolute value and the cost is that now c can also be negative.
[3311.80]  But somehow 0 is missing.
[3313.28]  How is that possible?
[3314.76]  That doesn't look like solid mathematics.
[3319.52]  Yes?
[3325.96]  That's right.
[3327.96]  Okay, so where did I lose that case?
[3335.36]  Right here.
[3336.52]  So I divided by y squared minus 1.
[3341.20]  I did that ignoring the case when y squared minus 1 is 0.
[3350.32]  So let's call this star here.
[3354.28]  So in star, y minus 1 is not 0.
[3364.44]  But if we need to allow that, because it is possible for y to be plus or minus 1, for example,
[3374.32]  if y is the constant function 1, then this is 0, dy dx is 0, so that's okay.
[3382.92]  So if we allow, if y is plus minus 1 is included in the solution, if we allow c to be 0,
[3404.96]  in the answer.
[3415.68]  So then the bottom line is that the answer is this implicit equation in y and x, where c
[3425.96]  can be any constant.
[3436.80]  Good?
[3441.00]  So be careful when you divide by the function in y, as I said here, you can do that if you
[3449.48]  know that's not 0.
[3451.16]  But sometimes you get solutions from it being 0.
[3454.08]  So you have to be careful there.
[3456.84]  All right, that's the end of the first lecture.
[3458.88]  I'll see you tomorrow for the second lecture and we'll do more differential equations.
